# Visual language

Every glyph is a single terminal cell, so the tree's columns never move, whatever is animating.
Animations use smoothstep curves and continuous colour mixing rather than on/off flashes. The pane
redraws at about 30 fps while anything moves.

## Operations

| Op | Glyph | Colour | Bright | Row tint |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| read | `◉` | `#58a6ff` | `#cfe6ff` | `#0c2d4f` |
| edit | `±` | `#f0883e` | `#ffe2c4` | `#3d2410` |
| create | `+` | `#3fb950` | `#d2f8dc` | `#0f3a1e` |
| delete | `✗` | `#f85149` | `#ffd7d5` | `#4a1316` |

Other colours: Claude's accent `#d97757` (the spark and prompt), text `#c9d1d9`, muted `#6e7681`,
folders `#8b98a5`, guides `#30363d`.

## The current file

Only one file at a time gets the strongest animation: the most recently started operation that's
still running. Its row gets:

- `▌` in the gutter, gently pulsing
- the op's tint behind the row
- its op animation (below)
- a dotted leader `╌╌╌` flowing from the right edge toward the file, ending in `◂ reading` with a
  shine sweeping across the word

Other operations running at the same time get only their glyph and a slow, quiet pulse.

### Running animations

- **read:** a band of light about 2.6 cells wide sweeps back and forth across the name every
  1.4 s, brightening the text and lighting the cells behind it blue.
- **edit:** a ripple runs along the name, each letter about 55 ms after the one before, like
  keystrokes landing. A cursor `▏` blinks after the name.
- **create:** for the first 700 ms the name types itself in with a bright leading edge, while the
  glyph grows `· → ∙ → • → +`. After that the name shimmers on a softly glowing green background.
- **delete:** the glyph and name pulse between their colour and bright red every 760 ms.

## Fading back to normal

After an operation ends, the file fades back step by step. Each step starts at the colour the
previous one ended with, so there's no visible jump.

| Stage | Time after the operation | Looks like |
| --- | --- | --- |
| done | 0 to 1.8 s | `✓` and name fade from bright to the op colour |
| recent | 1.8 to 20 s | the op glyph remains; the name fades from the op colour toward plain text |
| trail | 20 to 60 s | a faint `✓` fades out |
| normal | after 60 s | `·` and plain text |

## Deletion

A deleted file stays in the tree for 2.3 s, so you can see what happened:

| Time | Phase |
| --- | --- |
| 0 to 450 ms | Red highlight builds up behind the name |
| 450 to 1,050 ms | Damped shake: up to 3 cells of jolt, settling to still while the red softens |
| 1,050 to 2,300 ms | Dissolve: letters disappear from the right, each dimming before it goes, struck through |

A deleted folder shows as a single fading row instead of one row per file inside it.

## The path down the tree

- Tree guides (`├╴ └╴ │`) on the path down to the current file are drawn in its op colour, with a
  pulse flowing down from the top level.
- Parent folders on the path show `●`, `•` or `·`, getting smaller and dimmer the further up they
  are.
- Any other folder with recent activity below it shows a faint `·` and is coloured by that
  activity.
- A closed folder shows how many children it has, e.g. `+3`.

## Chrome

- **Header:** `✶ work-map ~/project`. The spark turns through `· ∙ • ◆ ✶` while Claude works.
- **Prompt line:**
  - working: `❯ editing src/app.ts 2.4s █`. The verb shimmers, the folder is muted, and the timer
    counts up.
  - thinking: `❯ thinking █`
  - idle: `❯ idle · N files █`
  - The block cursor always blinks.
- **Section rules:** `── tree ──` (with `↑N` when scrolled) and `── legend ──`.
- **Completion card:** a rounded box whose border fades in. `✓ TASK COMPLETE` appears letter by
  letter, then one row per operation slides in about 120 ms apart, its count and `━━━` bar
  growing. It fades out over the last 1.5 s of its 20 s.
